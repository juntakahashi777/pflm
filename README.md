Passes for Late Meal
====
This is a site we made for the Princeton University community that let students trade eating club passes for late meal. If youâ€™re not familiar with Princeton, these terms might not mean much to you, but the prospect of being able to trade these items was extremely popular amongst students. In its first weekend of release, the site attracted ~2,000 unique visitors on a campus of ~ 5,000. Unfortunately, the site raised concern from our university officials and its active existence was short-lived. Our live URL, passesforlatemeal.com, no longer links to the actual site. For demonstration purposes, the original site can be found at relic.passesforlatemeal.appspot.com. More details about the story of our site can be find here - http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/04/passes-for-late-meal-website-questioned-by-princeton-administration/.
