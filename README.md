Passes for Late Meal
====
This is a site we made for the Princeton University community that let students trade eating club passes for late meal. If you’re not familiar with Princeton, these terms might not mean much to you, but the prospect of being able to trade these items was extremely popular among students. In its first weekend of release, the site attracted ~2,000 unique visitors from a campus of ~5,000. Unfortunately, the site’s premise caught the attention of university administrators, so its active existence was short-lived. 

Our live URL, [passesforlatemeal.com](http://passesforlatemeal.com), no longer links to the actual site. For demonstration purposes, the original site can be found at [relic.passesforlatemeal.appspot.com](http://relic.passesforlatemeal.appspot.com).
